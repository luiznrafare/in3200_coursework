This is a submission for the IN3200 Coursework. Due to the 25Mb upload limit, I have included all the dataset in .txt format, however, they do not contain any content.
They are there to indicate where each file is supposed to go. This is specifically pertaining to the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset obtained from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

The following files from the above repository are used:

Inside the "UCI HAR Dataset folder" - 
activity_labels.txt
features.txt

Inside "train" folder - 
X_train.txt
y_train.txt

Inside the "test" folder - 
X_test.txt
y_test.txt
